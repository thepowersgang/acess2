Acess2 Binary File Loader Specification
---------------------------------------

Binary file loaders are defined by creating a \a tBinaryType variable that
is registered with the kernel.

\a tBinaryType contains seven fields.
-#	\a Next
	This field is used internally by the kernel and should be set to NULL
	when the definition is initialise and not changed by the driver.
-#	\a Ident
	This field tells the kernel how to recognise this file format. If the
	first 32-bits of the file (ANDed with the \a Mask field) match this
	value, the file will be passed to this loader.
-#	\a Mask
	Determines what bits in the first 32-bits of the file matter for the
	identifcation.
-#	\a Name
	This is a C string that uniquely identifies this binary format.
-#	\a Load
	This field is a pointer to a function that takes a VFS Handle of the
	source exectuable file as an argument and returns a \a tBinary
	pointer that defines the location and attributes of the exectable's
	segments. (See \a tBinary for more information)
